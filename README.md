# Purpose
There are several use cases that we can solve by the current AI product.
However, there are small gaps between the in-house engineers and engineers in AI industry.
I want to solve this problem by building pipeline to share API with the engineers who work in the every industry, such as e-commerce, finance, payment, social media, etc.

# Solution
With the simple demo by Streamlit, the engineers in your company can easily integrate pipeline through API, which is the common language between engineers.
